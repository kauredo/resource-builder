Style: Clean, friendly, professional but not clinical. Rounded corners and soft edges. Should work at 32px and 512px. No text, just the mark.

## Emotion Card Illustration Prompts

Each card is 144×192px, so illustrations should be roughly square and centered. The background color is already set — you need just the illustration on a white background.

### Happy (Background: #FF6B6B coral)

```
A joyful child character illustration showing happiness. Soft, rounded cartoon style with gentle lines. The character has a big genuine smile, bright eyes, maybe arms raised or hugging themselves.

Style: Warm, child-friendly, soft watercolor-meets-vector aesthetic. Rounded shapes, no sharp edges. Gentle shading. Think children's book illustration, not clip art.

Colors: Use warm tones that complement coral red — cream, soft yellow, warm white. Avoid pure white.

Centered composition. Simple, uncluttered.
```

### Calm (Background: #6B9080 sage green)

```
A peaceful child character illustration showing calmness/serenity. Soft, rounded cartoon style. The character has relaxed posture, gentle closed-eye smile or soft gaze, maybe hands resting on chest or in a peaceful pose.

Style: Minimalist and soothing. Simple line work with soft fills. Zen-like simplicity. Gentle curves, lots of breathing room.

Colors: Use soft, muted tones that complement sage green — cream, soft mint, warm gray-greens.

Centered composition. Sparse, peaceful.
```

### Sad (Background: #5390D9 blue)

```
A gentle child character illustration showing sadness. Soft, rounded cartoon style. The character has downturned mouth, maybe a single tear, slumped shoulders, looking down. Sympathetic, not dramatic or distressing.

Style: Soft and comforting despite the emotion. Rounded shapes, gentle lines. The sadness should feel validated, not scary. Think therapeutic illustration.

Colors: Use soft tones that complement blue — cream, soft lavender, muted periwinkle.

Centered composition. Tender, not bleak.
```

### Excited (Background: #C77DFF purple)

```
An energetic child character illustration showing excitement. Soft, rounded cartoon style. The character has wide eyes, big open smile, dynamic pose — maybe jumping, arms wide, or bouncing. Joyful energy.

Style: Playful and dynamic but still soft-edged. Movement suggested through pose, not speed lines. Whimsical, sparkly energy without being overwhelming.

Colors: Use warm tones that complement purple — soft gold, warm cream, touches of pink.

Centered composition. Energetic but contained.
```

### Style Notes for All Cards

To maintain consistency across the set:

- Same character or character style (similar face shape, proportions)
- Same line weight and shading approach
- Same level of detail/simplicity
- Child appears age 6-10, gender-neutral presentation
- No text or labels in the illustration
- Soft, rounded aesthetic throughout — no sharp angles
- Should feel like they belong in the same deck
